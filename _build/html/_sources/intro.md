The course, taught by Professor <a href='https://masonkorea.gmu.edu/people/ecastrom' target='_blank'>Edgar Castro</a>, offers an introduction to research methodologies using scientific experiments. It is valuable for anyone interested in learning how to conduct research using experimentation techniques. However, it is primarily geared toward behavioral experiments conducted by economists.
